# Study Cards

See it live: [Study Cards](https://astonishing-heliotrope-9c8a6a.netlify.app/)

## Description
A small app that allows a user to create a series of virtual "study cards" to help with studying/memorization. Each card as a front side, containing the question, and a back side, containing the answer. User can flip the card to get the answer at any time as well as sift through all existing cards.

## Background & Process
This project was based on a course I was doing, which I then re-coded on my own. It was one of the more challenging projects to code as it required functionality for creating a new card, flipping it, sifting through all the cards, and adding/retrieving cards from localStorage.

## Technologies
The current version of this project was done with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## State of Completion
Completed.

## Learning Lessons & Challenges
### JavaScript: Creating new cards and saving/retrieving existing ones from local storage
This required a lot of careful logic. First, if local storage had cards already stored, I needed to retrive that data and create cards based on that. On top of that, user had to be able to create a new card at any time, which also had to be added to local storage.

### CSS: Flipping the card
This was a tough thing to implement as it required several layers to be added to each card and then using specific CSS rules (such as     transform-style: preserve-3d;) to implement the flipping effect. A challenge and a useful learning experience!

## Summary
This was a challenging project and a very good learning experience. Would like to do more projects like this in the future.
